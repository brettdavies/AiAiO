## Development Process

Before starting any task:

1. **Review Required Documentation**
   - [Git Workflow Guidelines](../../.cursor/rules/git_workflow.mdc) - **REQUIRED** for all commits and PRs
   - [Swift Rules](../../.cursor/rules/swift-rules.mdc) - For Swift code
   - [Project Structure](../../.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc) - For file organization

2. **Git Workflow Summary**
   - Create feature branch: `feature/slice7-task<N>-<description>`
   - Make atomic commits following [commit conventions](../git_workflow.md#commit-process)
   - Create PR with comprehensive description
   - Squash merge to development after review
   - Delete feature branch after merge

3. **Pull Request Requirements**
   - All tests must pass
   - Code must follow style guides
   - Changes must be atomic and focused
   - PR description must be detailed
   - Squash merge is required

## Goals of Slice 7

1. **Unit & ViewModel Tests**: Cover AuthViewModel, GroupViewModel, VideoUploadViewModel, etc.  
2. **Integration Tests**: Use local Firebase Emulators to confirm Firestore, Auth, Storage interactions.  
3. **UI Tests**: Basic SwiftUI UI tests or snapshot tests to verify layout and workflows.  
4. **Code Quality**: SwiftLint + concurrency checks in the CI pipeline to maintain consistent style and safe concurrency.

## Implementation Steps

### Task 7.1 Unit & ViewModel Tests

**Objective**: Write XCTest-based tests for core logic in each module.

1. **Step 1**: `feature/slice7-task7.1-unit-tests`.  
2. **Step 2**: Add `Tests/AppTests/` folder for unit tests.  
   - Test sign-in/out logic in `AuthViewModelTests.swift`.  
   - Test create/edit group in `GroupViewModelTests.swift`.  
   - Test video validation in `VideoUploadViewModelTests.swift`.  
3. **Step 3**: Ensure all pass locally.  
4. **Step 4**: Merge once CI pipeline passes.

**Definition of Done** (Machine-Readable):

- Unit tests exist for all major ViewModels (Auth, Groups, Video).
- All tests pass in Xcode and CI.
- Merged into `development`.

---

### Task 7.2 Integration Tests with Firebase Emulators

**Objective**: Validate end-to-end flows (auth, group creation, video upload) using local emulators in a test suite.

1. **Step 1**: `feature/slice7-task7.2-integration-tests`.  
2. **Step 2**: Add `IntegrationTests/` folder.  
3. **Step 3**: Use Xcode or Swift test frameworks to:
   - Spin up emulator (could be a script that runs `firebase emulators:start` in parallel).  
   - Create a user, create a group, upload a video, verify AI metadata, etc.  
4. **Step 4**: Merge once stable.

**Definition of Done** (Machine-Readable):

- Automated integration tests run with the Firebase Emulators, verifying major workflows.
- Tests pass in CI environment.
- PR merges after successful checks.

---

### Task 7.3 UI Tests & Snapshots

**Objective**: Basic UI automation or snapshot tests (XCUITest) to confirm SwiftUI screens load properly.

1. **Step 1**: `feature/slice7-task7.3-ui-tests`.  
2. **Step 2**: In `UITests/`, create tests for sign-in, group creation, video upload steps.  
3. **Step 3**: Optionally integrate snapshot testing frameworks (e.g., Swift Snapshot Testing).  
4. **Step 4**: Merge once the automated UI tests pass.

**Definition of Done** (Machine-Readable):

- UI tests or snapshot tests run automatically in CI for major user flows.
- Merged to `development` after success.

---

### Task 7.4 SwiftLint & Concurrency Checks

**Objective**: Maintain code style and concurrency safety using SwiftLint + Xcode concurrency checks.

1. **Step 1**: `feature/slice7-task7.4-lint-concurrency`.  
2. **Step 2**: Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run SwiftLint.  
3. **Step 3**: Ensure strict concurrency checking is enabled in the Xcode project.  
4. **Step 4**: Resolve any lint or concurrency warnings.  
5. **Step 5**: Merge after CI is clean.

**Definition of Done** (Machine-Readable):

- SwiftLint is part of CI, with zero lint errors on merge.
- No concurrency warnings remain in Xcode.
- PR merges into `development` successfully.

---

### Task 7.5 Verification / Demo

**Objective**: Show complete coverage metrics and test runs in CI pipeline.

1. **Step 1**: `feature/slice7-task7.5-verification`.  
2. **Step 2**: Run final test suite locally + in CI.  
3. **Step 3**: Provide coverage report or summary.  
4. **Step 4**: Merge once stable.

**Definition of Done** (Machine-Readable):

- Full test suite (unit, integration, UI) runs in CI with passing results.
- Coverage meets or exceeds agreed target (if specified).
- Merged into `development` with passing checks.

---

## Estimated Timeline

- **3-5 Days** for setting up and refining tests, depending on coverage goals.

---

## Next Steps After Slice 7

- Proceed to **Slice 8 (Deployment & Beta Distribution)**, packaging the final app for internal/external testers.
