## Development Process

Before starting any task:

1. **Review Required Documentation**
   - [Git Workflow Guidelines](../../.cursor/rules/git_workflow.mdc) - **REQUIRED** for all commits and PRs
   - [Swift Rules](../../.cursor/rules/swift-rules.mdc) - For Swift code
   - [Project Structure](../../.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc) - For file organization

2. **Git Workflow Summary**
   - Create feature branch: `feature/slice8-task<N>-<description>`
   - Make atomic commits following [commit conventions](../git_workflow.md#commit-process)
   - Create PR with comprehensive description
   - Squash merge to development after review
   - Delete feature branch after merge

3. **Pull Request Requirements**
   - All tests must pass
   - Code must follow style guides
   - Changes must be atomic and focused
   - PR description must be detailed
   - Squash merge is required

## Goals of Slice 8

1. **Deployment Pipeline**: Build and distribute the iOS app either via TestFlight or Firebase App Distribution.  
2. **Production Project Rules**: Deploy final Firestore/Storage rules to the `prod` alias.  
3. **Beta Testing**: Allow external testers to try sign-in, group creation, video upload, AI processing, etc.  
4. **Feedback & Monitoring**: Monitor logs, gather feedback, plan future enhancements.

## Implementation Steps

### Task 8.1 TestFlight or Firebase App Distribution Setup

**Objective**: Decide on distribution method and configure the pipeline accordingly.

1. **Step 1**: `feature/slice8-task8.1-distribution`.  
2. **Step 2**: If using **TestFlight**: set up Apple Developer certs, provisioning profiles in Xcode.  
   - Automate build uploads (`xcodebuild archive`, then `altool` or `Transporter`).  
3. **Step 3**: If using **Firebase App Distribution**: add the App Distribution SDK in Xcode SPM, update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run `firebase appdistribution:distribute`.  
4. **Step 4**: Merge after verifying a test build can be uploaded.

**Definition of Done** (Machine-Readable):

- A reproducible script or CI step can produce an IPA and upload it to either TestFlight or Firebase App Distribution.
- No manual dashboard steps unless absolutely needed.

---

### Task 8.2 Production Project Rules/Config

**Objective**: Finalize rules for `prod` environment, enabling real usage.

1. **Step 1**: `feature/slice8-task8.2-prod-rules`.  
2. **Step 2**: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules --project prod`.  
3. **Step 3**: If needed, create a separate `.firebaserc` or environment references for `prod`.  
4. **Step 4**: Merge after verifying in actual production environment.

**Definition of Done** (Machine-Readable):

- Production Firestore/Storage rules are deployed via CLI, matching the final zero-trust setup from dev.
- PR merges successfully.

---

### Task 8.3 Beta Release & Versioning

**Objective**: Tag a "v1.0.0-beta" release, push to `main`, and invite testers.

1. **Step 1**: `feature/slice8-task8.3-beta-release`.  
2. **Step 2**: Merge `development` into `main`.  
3. **Step 3**: Tag the merge commit as "v1.0.0-beta".  
4. **Step 4**: Distribute build to testers, possibly adding them via Apple TestFlight or a Firebase console link.  
5. **Step 5**: Confirm testers can install and run the app.

**Definition of Done** (Machine-Readable):

- A "v1.0.0-beta" tag is published in Git.
- A build is distributed to external testers with no console misconfig.
- Merged to `main` with passing CI checks.

---

### Task 8.4 Feedback & Monitoring

**Objective**: Collect logs, track crash reports, and gather user feedback for future improvements.

1. **Step 1**: `feature/slice8-task8.4-feedback-monitoring`.  
2. **Step 2**: Ensure Crashlytics or any analytics is capturing real user errors.  
3. **Step 3**: Possibly create a feedback form in the app or track issues in GitHub.  
4. **Step 4**: Summarize findings for a next-phase plan.

**Definition of Done** (Machine-Readable):

- Crashlytics or an equivalent logs real-time issues from testers.
- Documented user feedback is available for prioritizing future updates.
- PR merges to `main` with final release notes.

---

## Estimated Timeline

- **2-4 Days** to finalize the distribution pipeline, production rules, and gather initial feedback.

---

## Project Completion

Once Slice 8 is done, AiAiO's MVP is officially **deployable**. Further slices can add advanced face-blurring or more sophisticated AI features, but at this point, the vertical slices needed to cover the "creator workflow" are complete.
